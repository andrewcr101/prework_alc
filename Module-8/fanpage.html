    <h2>Bio</h2>
    
    <pre>Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael were five brothers from Gary, Indiana, who became one of the biggest pop groups in music history. 
         One of Motown's most successful acts in the 1970s, The Jackson 5 had four of their first singles hit the top of the Billboard chart, but the group's
         appeal was more than just musical - they were among the first black teen idols to appeal to a white audience. The Jackson 5's mix of mind-blowing musical 
         talent and sheer charisma earned the family the status of pop royalty in the music business and later helped launch Michael's legendary solo career.</pre>
